# basic-generic-RouterOS-PPP-secret-generator

A tool used to create generic username/password combinations for PPP secrets on Mikrotik RouterOS. 

Format for username is as follows:
{Base name} {letter} {number}
For example: BaseA5

Format for password is as follows:
{Base password} {letter} {number} AZ {number}
For example: BaseA5AZ5

Generate secrets one at a time or generate all secrets based on user input. IP range will continue onto next octet once 254 addresses are reached. E.G. after 10.10.10.254 will come 10.10.11.254. The local ip address is also automatically generated by using the 1st address in the last octect, e.g. 10.10.10.69 will have a local address of 10.10.10.1.
